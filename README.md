Contoso, Ltd. has major holdings in one of the worldâ€™s most important oil-producing regions. To overcome the challenges of monitoring and optimizing a vast number of widely dispersed field assets, Contoso, Ltd. is looking to streamline its operations with IoT solutions. They want to deploy IoT technologies to electronically collect data and use cloud-based solutions to store and analyze it in order to gain new insights into well operations and future drilling possibilities.

## Abstracts

### Workshop

In this workshop, you will look at the process for designing and implementing an oil and gas manufacturing IoT solution that is secured following best practices.

At the end of this workshop, you will be better able to architect a comprehensive and secure oil and gas manufacturing IoT solution.

### Whiteboard design session

In this whiteboard design session, you will look at the process for designing an oil and gas manufacturing IoT solution that is secured following best practices. You will learn how to monitor and manage the security of all components in the solution You will also provide Contoso guidance on defining life cycles for particular components so that they have a plan that begins with initial deployment, to expected maintenance, to planned end-of-life and ultimately through decommissioning of the device so that they can understand how Azure supports this. Additionally, you will perform some threat modeling to help Contoso think about how they might handle STRIDE threats (spoofing of user identity, tampering, repudiation, information disclosure, denial of service, elevation of privilege).  

At the end of this whiteboard design session, you will be better able to architect a comprehensive and secure oil and gas manufacturing IoT solution.

### Hands-on lab

In this hands-on lab, you will look at the process for implementing an oil and gas manufacturing IoT solution that is secured following best practices. You will learn how to monitor and manage the security of all components in the solution.
